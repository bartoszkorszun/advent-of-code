# Day 16: Aunt Sue

## Part 1

You received a gift from **Aunt Sue**, but with **500 possible Aunts Sue**, you need to figure out which one sent it. Your **Crime Scene Analysis Machine (MFCSAM)** provides a list of detected compounds, and each Aunt Sue has a partial list of what they own.  

**Goal:** Find the Aunt Sue whose known attributes **match exactly** with the MFCSAM output.  

## Part 2

You realize the machine's **retroencabulator** is outdated, meaning some values aren't exact:  
- **Cats and trees** readings are actually **greater than** the given value.  
- **Pomeranians and goldfish** readings are **less than** the given value.  

**Goal:** Find the real Aunt Sue using these adjusted rules.
