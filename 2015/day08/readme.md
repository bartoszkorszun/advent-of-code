# Day 8: Matchsticks

## Part 1  

Santa needs to determine the difference between the **number of characters in a string's code representation** and the **number of characters in memory** when the string is actually stored. The strings use escape sequences like:  
- `\\` for a single backslash  
- `\"` for a double quote  
- `\x27` for a single ASCII character  

Calculate the **total difference** between these two counts for all strings in Santa’s list.

## Part 2  

Now, **encode each string** by escaping necessary characters and adding extra double quotes. Then, determine the **difference** between:  
- The total number of characters in the **new encoded representation**  
- The original number of characters in the **code representation**  

Calculate this total difference for all strings in Santa’s list.
