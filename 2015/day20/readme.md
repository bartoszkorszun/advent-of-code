Determine the **lowest house number** that receives at least a given number of presents, based on different delivery rules.  

## Part 1

- Each Elf **n** delivers presents to every multiple of **n**.  
- Each delivery equals **10 times** the Elf's number.  
- Find the **smallest house number** that receives at least the given number of presents.  

## Part 2

- Each Elf now **only delivers to 50 houses** (instead of infinitely many).  
- Each delivery equals **11 times** the Elf's number.  
- Find the new **lowest house number** meeting the present requirement.
