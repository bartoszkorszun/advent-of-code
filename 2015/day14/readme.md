# Day 14: Reindeer Olympics

## Part 1
Reindeer race by flying at a set speed for a duration, then resting before repeating the cycle. Given each reindeer's stats, determine how far the winning reindeer travels in **2503 seconds**.  

## Part 2  

Instead of distance, Santa now awards **1 point per second** to the leading reindeer. If there's a tie, all leaders get a point. Calculate the highest score after **2503 seconds**.
