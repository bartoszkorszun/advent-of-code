# Day 10: Elves Look, Elves Say

## Part 1  

The Elves are playing the **look-and-say** game, where each sequence is generated by describing the previous sequence in terms of consecutive runs of digits. Given a starting number, apply this transformation **40 times** and determine the **length of the final sequence**.  

## Part 2  

Using the same transformation, apply the process **50 times** instead of 40. Determine the **length of the final sequence** after 50 iterations.
