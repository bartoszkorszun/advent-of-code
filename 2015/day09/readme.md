# Day 9: All in a Single Night

## Part 1  

Santa needs to travel between multiple locations, visiting **each location exactly once**. Given a list of distances between every pair of locations, determine the **shortest possible route** he can take.

## Part 2  

Instead of minimizing the distance, Santa now wants to take the **longest possible route** while still visiting each location exactly once.  

Find the **longest route distance** based on the given distances.
