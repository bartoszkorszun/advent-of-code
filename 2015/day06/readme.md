# Day 6: Probably a Fire Hazard

## Part 1  

You have a **1000x1000 grid of lights**, all initially turned off. Santa provides **instructions** to:  
- **Turn on** all lights in a given range.  
- **Turn off** all lights in a given range.  
- **Toggle** (invert) all lights in a given range.  

Determine how many lights are **lit** after executing all instructions.

## Part 2  

The grid now supports **brightness control** instead of simple on/off states:  
- **"Turn on"** increases brightness by **1**.  
- **"Turn off"** decreases brightness by **1** (minimum brightness is **0**).  
- **"Toggle"** increases brightness by **2**.  

Determine the **total brightness** of all lights after executing all instructions.
