# Day 24: It Hangs in the Balance

## Goal

Distribute Santa's **packages** into either **three** (Part 1) or **four** (Part 2) **equal-weight groups** while:  
1. **Minimizing** the number of packages in the **first group** (passenger compartment).  
2. If multiple solutions exist, picking the one with the **smallest quantum entanglement** (product of weights).  

## Part 1

- Divide the total package weight **by 3** to determine the weight each group must have.  
- Find the **smallest** set of packages that can sum to this weight.  
- If multiple solutions exist, select the one with the **lowest** quantum entanglement (QE).  

## Part 2

- Now, the total package weight must be divided **by 4** instead of 3.  
- The same process applies:  
  - Find the **smallest** first group.
  - If tied, pick the **lowest** QE.
