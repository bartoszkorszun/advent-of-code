# Day 5: Doesn't He Have Intern-Elves For This?

## Part 1  

A string is **nice** if it meets all of these conditions:  
- Contains at least **three vowels** (`aeiou`).  
- Has at least **one letter that appears twice in a row**.  
- **Does not contain** the strings `ab`, `cd`, `pq`, or `xy`.  

Determine how many strings in a given text file are **nice**.

## Part 2  

The rules for a **nice** string have changed:  
- It must contain a **pair of any two letters** that appears at least **twice** in the string **without overlapping**.  
- It must contain at least **one letter that repeats** with **exactly one letter between**.  

Determine how many strings meet these new conditions.
