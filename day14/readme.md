# Day 14

This day's challenge involves navigating a swarm of robots to ensure the safe passage of "The Historian" to a bathroom. The puzzle is divided into two parts:

## Part 1

Predict the positions of the robots after a set amount of time and compute a safety factor based on their distribution.

## Part 2

Find the shortest time at which the robots arrange themselves into a recognizable pattern (a "Christmas tree").
