# Day 2

## Part 1

Analyze a list of reports, where each report contains a sequence of levels. Determine which reports are "safe" based on two criteria:

1. The levels must either increase or decrease throughout the report.
2. The difference between any two adjacent levels must be between 1 and 3 (inclusive).

Count the reports that meet both criteria.
