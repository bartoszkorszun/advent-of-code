# Day 15

This program simulates a malfunctioning robot in a lanternfish-operated warehouse. The robot attempts to move (<, >, ^, v) while pushing boxes, avoiding walls and invalid moves. The goal is to calculate the final positions of the boxes and their summed GPS coordinates.

## Part 1 

The map consists of 
- # - walls
- 'O' - boxes
- '@' - robot
- '.' - empty spot

## Part 2

The goal is the same but map changes as follows:
- '#' - changes to '##'
- 'O' - changes to '[]'
- '@' - changes to '@.'
- '.' - changes to '..'
