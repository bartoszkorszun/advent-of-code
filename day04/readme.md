# Day 4

## Part 1

Help an Elf find all instances of the word **XMAS** in a grid of letters. The word can appear in any direction: horizontally, vertically, diagonally, reversed, and overlapping other words. Count every occurrence of **XMAS** in the puzzle.

## Part 2

This puzzle requires finding patterns of two **MAS** in the shape of an **X** within a grid of letters. Each **MAS** can be written forwards or backwards, forming an X-like structure:

```
M.S
.A.
M.S
```

Irrelevant letters are ignored. Count all such X-MAS patterns in the grid.
