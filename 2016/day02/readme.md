# Day 2: Bathroom Security

## Part 1

You need to find the bathroom code using a standard 3Ã—3 keypad:  

```
1 2 3  
4 5 6  
7 8 9  
```  

- You start at the **"5"** button.  
- Follow the given movement instructions: **U (up), D (down), L (left), and R (right)**.  
- If a move would take you off the keypad, ignore it and stay on the same button.  
- Each line of instructions corresponds to a single button press.  
- The final sequence of buttons pressed forms the bathroom code.  

## Part 2

The keypad is now **different and irregularly shaped**:  

```
    1  
  2 3 4  
5 6 7 8 9  
  A B C  
    D  
```  

- You still start at **"5"** and follow the same movement rules.  
- If a move would take you off this **diamond-shaped keypad**, ignore it.  
- Again, each line of instructions corresponds to a single button press.  
- The final sequence of buttons pressed forms the new bathroom code.  

Find the correct code for this new keypad using the same movement instructions. ðŸš½ðŸ”¢
