# Day 10: Balance Bots

## Part 1

In a microchip-handling factory, bots receive and compare chips containing integer values. Each bot follows specific instructions: once it holds two chips, it gives the lower-valued chip to one recipient (another bot or an output bin) and the higher-valued chip to another. Some instructions also assign chips directly to bots. The task is to determine which bot is responsible for comparing two specific chip values.

# Part 2

After identifying which bots handled specific comparisons, the focus shifts to the output bins. Specifically, the goal is to determine the product of the values in outputs 0, 1, and 2, once all instructions have been executed and the chips distributed.
