# Day 8

## Part 1

Identify unique antinode locations caused by antennas on a grid. An antinode forms at positions perfectly in line with two antennas of the same frequency, where one antenna is exactly twice the distance from the other. Calculate the total number of unique antinode locations within the grid boundaries.

## Part 2

Expand the model to include resonant harmonics. Now, an antinode forms at any position in line with at least two antennas of the same frequency, regardless of their distances. Antennas themselves count as antinodes unless they are the only one of their frequency. Recalculate the total unique antinode locations using this updated rule.
