# Day 13

This task involves solving a puzzle related to arcade claw machines with unusual mechanics. Each claw machine has two buttons, A and B, that move the claw by specific amounts on the X and Y axes. Each button press costs tokens, and the goal is to align the claw with the prize's exact coordinates using the minimum number of tokens.

## Part 1

The task is to determine how many prizes can be won and the fewest tokens required to do so, given each machine's button configurations and prize locations.

## Part 2

The prize coordinates are shifted by \(10^{13}\) due to a unit conversion error. The task is updated to account for this change, requiring efficient algorithms to handle large numbers and potentially many button presses.

The solution computes the maximum number of prizes that can be won and the minimum tokens needed, using mathematical techniques such as solving linear Diophantine equations.
