# Day 12

Given a map of garden plots, group regions of the same plant type and calculate fencing costs based on two methods:
## Part 1

- Calculate fencing costs for each region using area × perimeter.

## Part 2

- With a bulk discount, calculate fencing costs using area × number of sides instead of the perimeter.

Both parts involve summing up the costs for all regions on the map.
