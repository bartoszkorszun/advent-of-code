# Day 6

## Part 1

In 1518, a guard patrols a lab following strict rules: move forward unless blocked, then turn right. Given a map with obstacles (#) and the guard's starting position (^, v, <, or >), determine how many distinct positions the guard visits before leaving the map.

## Part 2

The Historians need to place one new obstruction in the lab to trap the guard in a loop, ensuring the rest of the lab is safe to explore. The obstruction cannot be at the guard's starting position. Determine the number of possible positions for this obstruction where the guard would get stuck in a patrol loop.
